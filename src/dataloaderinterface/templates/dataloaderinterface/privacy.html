                    <p>It is our policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating
                        our websites.</p>
                    <h6 class="section-title">What Personal Data We Collect and Why We Collect It</h6>
                    <h6>Non-Personally-Identifying Information</h6>
                    <p>Like most website operators, Stroud Water Research Center and LimnoTech collect
                        non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make
                        available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time
                        of each visitor request.</p>
                    <p>Our purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how our
                        visitors use the website. From time to time, Stroud Water Research Center and LimnoTech may
                        release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on
                        trends in the usage of its website.</p>
                    <h6>Personally-Identifying Information</h6>
                    <p>Certain visitors to our websites choose to interact with Stroud Water Research Center and
                        LimnoTech in ways that require us to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and
                        type of information that we gather depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask
                        visitors who sign up at <a href="{% url 'home' %}">https://MonitorMyWatershed.org</a> to provide
                        their first and last names and email address.</p>
                    <p>Those who engage in transactions with Stroud Water Research Center and LimnoTech are asked to
                        provide additional information, including as necessary the personal and financial information
                        required to process those transactions. In each case, Stroud Water Research Center and LimnoTech
                        collect such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of
                        the visitor's interaction with Stroud Water Research Center and LimnoTech.</p>
                    <p>Stroud Water Research Center and LimnoTech do not disclose personally-identifying information

                        information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related
                        activities.</p>
